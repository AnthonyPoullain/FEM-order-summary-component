## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Tailwind 2.2.7
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this challenge to build my first project with Tailwind CSS. The documentation is great and knowing my CSS properties really made it easy and fast to use. One drawback though, you have to have the same styling properties twice if you have twice the same element. But I see how it would work great with component-based frameworks like React, where you don't have this issue.
